# Terminus: b0rk3d f0rk3d (formerly HorseMenu)  

A mod menu for Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online published by Rockstar Games.  
**Strictly for educational purposes.**  

**Fork Reason:** Menu styling updates and various fixes.  
**b0rk3d-f0rk3d:** So there's no mistaking this for the Master build.  

## How to use:  
Use a popular injector available on GitHub and inject into `rdr2.exe`.  
Or, visit [PlumbWick3d's Discord](https://discord.gg/Bzjtda42) for an *AIO* with the latest build and injector!
